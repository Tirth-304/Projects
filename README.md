# Projects

Mainly, I have worked on Natural Language Processing, Image Recognition, Classification & Regression.
Here are some of the projects I made while learning and some by myself.

## Image Recognition

1. Food Recognition - Just by clicking a picture of food. One can find which food it is. For Image classification, Deep Neural networks, Convolution neural networks can work.

2. Cloth Recognition - In Image recognition, We might need to identify things by thermal images. So, this model works on thermal images and recognizes things. This can be used at airports, Railway stations to scan through items and alert police if a person has suspicious items.

## Natural Language processing

1. Email Spam/Non-Spam classifier - In this digital world, not all emails are important. We need to classify them as Spam and Non-Spam to reduce fishing cases. This was implemented using a basic machine learning model, a Decision tree.

2. Text content classifier - On the internet, lots of data is available. But while searching, we want to get only related results. First, we need to divide data into different categories like objective, conclusion, overview, etc. I have used advanced techniques like CNN, Transfer learning to make this possible.

3. Tweet Checker - In tweeter, each day, a lot of tweets have been posted. Some of them might have disrespectful, vulgar. So, that needs to hide and show only valuable tweets. This can be implemented using advanced Neural networks.

## Classification

1. Hotel Booking Cancellation - In hotels, the Cancelation of rooms is a significant problem. But to overcome this problem. I have made a model that can predict the probability of a person canceling beforehand. I have shown analysis I have done to predict cancellation. To achieve this purpose, logistic regression, decision tree classifier, KNN classifier, etc.

2. Kidney Disease - Instead of going to doctors, One can see the probability of having kidney disease by entering required fields. I have used xgboost to solve it.

3. Titanic - Have you seen Titanic? Let's predict whether a person can survive in the Titanic tragedy or not by running ML on their ticket details. Use any kind of classifier and have results.

4. IRIS flower type prediction - It's a simple ML project which tells which type of IRIS plant is this by providing Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal length & Petal width. Supervised and Unsupervised learning both can be used in this case.

## Regression

1. Flight Price Prediction - Predict the flight price by providing airline name, destination, source, route details.

2. House Price Prediction - By giving location, Plot Area, Facilities, one can predict the price of a house while selling OR buying, which can benefit buyers and owners on both sides.
